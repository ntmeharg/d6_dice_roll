Rolls D6 system dice

What it does
It asks for an input from the user of how many d6 dice it wants and the user puts a number.  The max is 10.

The code picks generates 6 random numbers.  The first number is the wild die.  If the number is 1 it will subtract the highest die.  If you get six you get add another extra die.  If the extra die gets 6 it repeats and you get to add it.
